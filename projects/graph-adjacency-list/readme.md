According to directed or undirected, edge-first or node-first, sparse or dense, eight implementations can be distinguished.

Generally speaking, the performance of edge-first query for edges and bridges is high, and the performance of query nodes is low. 

The performance of node-first graph query nodes and neighbors is high, and the performance of query edges is low.

The query performance of dense graph is higher than that of sparse graph, and the space occupied by directed graph is larger than that of undirected graph.
